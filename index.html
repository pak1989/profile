    <p>
      Hello there I'm Paolo, from Rome IT.<br>
      I own <a target="blank" href="homegallery101.com">a small B&B</a> that I run with the help of my family, and that has been my job for the last 3 years. <br>
      With the input of friends, and people I knew while travelling, I decided to learn code and change my life!
